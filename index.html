  <p>Hi. We're <a href="http://devpost.com">Devpost</a>, the home for hackers. Every day we come to work to do one thing:</p>

  <p class="celebrate">ðŸŽ‰ Celebrate software &amp; the people who make it ðŸ™Œ</p>

  <p>How do you celebrate your software on Devpost? <strong><a href="https://secure.devpost.com/users/register">Create a portfolio and write the story behind your code.</a></strong> Explain what inspired you, how you and your team worked together, the obstacles you ran into, and how you overcame them.</p>

  <p>Remember, landing pages sell, readmes are instructional, but stories offer real insight. </p>

  <p>There are <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of developers out there who are eager to learn from you and your experiences. And they're on Devpost too.</p>

  <p>Here are four examples of people telling their stories, their way:</p>

  <!-- this will be a flexbox of actual project layouts linked to projects or maybe with some sort of popover???-->

  <!-- FIN -->

  <p>Our motto is <strong>&ldquo;Devpost or it didn't happen.&rdquo;</strong> Because, if you don't tell anyone about your software, how will people ever find out about it? Nobody can explain your hacks better than you!</p>

  <p>We aren't a PR channel, crowd-funding site, SaaS, link aggregator, or hype machine. We <em>are</em> a supportive community of hackers who love building and learning (and emoji). Even if your project isn't finished, share your progress and keep your followers up to date.</p>

  <p class="center"><a href="https://secure.devpost.com/users/register" class="button">Get started and tell your story</a></p>

  <p>Oh, and if you like <a href="devpost.com/hackathons">hackathons</a>, you'll dig our weekly newsletter. Every Thursday we'll tell you about new online and in-person hackathons, plus awesome projects from hackers just like you.</p>

  <p>Thanks!</p>

  <p>ðŸ˜º Brandon, Holly, Richard, Serena, Peter, Neal, Elle, Jonathan, Joanna, Robin, Matt Z, Robin, Matt G, Stefanie, Brian, Desiree, and Ross</p>
